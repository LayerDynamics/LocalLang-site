/// # Math Operations Module
///
/// This module provides a variety of mathematical operations, such as 
/// addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with utilities 
/// to work with numbers. It also includes handling for specific edge cases 
/// like division by zero.
///
/// # Why
///
/// This module was implemented to encapsulate commonly used mathematical 
/// operations in a reusable and maintainable way, ensuring that numerical 
/// computations across the codebase follow consistent logic.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::math_operations::{add, divide};
///
/// let sum = add(5, 7);
/// assert_eq!(sum, 12);
///
/// let quotient = divide(10, 2).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(quotient, 5);
/// ```
pub mod math_operations {

    /// Adds two numbers together.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = add(3, 4);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 7);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Why
    ///
    /// This function provides a basic addition operation. It is implemented 
    /// using Rust's built-in `+` operator, which ensures correct handling of 
    /// integer overflow using wrapping arithmetic if needed.
    pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        a + b
    }

    /// Subtracts the second number from the first.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = subtract(10, 3);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 7);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Why
    ///
    /// This function performs subtraction, ensuring that negative results 
    /// are handled appropriately when the second number is larger than the 
    /// first.
    pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        a - b
    }

    /// Multiplies two numbers together.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = multiply(4, 5);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 20);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Why
    ///
    /// This function multiplies two integers, leveraging Rust's safe 
    /// arithmetic operations.
    pub fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
        a * b
    }

    /// Divides the first number by the second, returning a `Result` to 
    /// handle division by zero.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = divide(10, 2).unwrap();
    /// assert_eq!(result, 5);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function returns an `Err` if the second argument is zero, 
    /// preventing a divide-by-zero panic.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// This function will panic if the caller unwraps an error result, so 
    /// it is important to handle the error case appropriately.
    pub fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
        if b == 0 {
            Err("Cannot divide by zero")
        } else {
            Ok(a / b)
        }
    }

    /// Raises a number to a power.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = power(2, 3);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 8);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// This function uses safe arithmetic operations to compute the result. 
    /// However, care should be taken when raising a number to a large power, 
    /// as this may cause overflow.
    pub fn power(base: i32, exp: u32) -> i32 {
        base.pow(exp)
    }

    /// Computes the square root of a number, returning a `Result` to handle 
    /// negative input.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = sqrt(16).unwrap();
    /// assert_eq!(result, 4.0);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function returns an `Err` if the input is negative, as the 
    /// square root of a negative number is not a real number.
    ///
    /// # Why
    ///
    /// This function was implemented to ensure that square root calculations 
    /// are handled consistently across the codebase, with proper error 
    /// handling for negative inputs.
    pub fn sqrt(value: f64) -> Result<f64, &'static str> {
        if value < 0.0 {
            Err("Cannot compute the square root of a negative number")
        } else {

### **Explanation of the Example File:**

1. **Module-Level Documentation**:
    - The `math_operations` module is documented at the top, explaining its purpose and why it was implemented. This includes a high-level overview of the operations it provides and their intended usage.

2. **Function-Level Documentation**:
    - Each function (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `power`, `sqrt`) has detailed documentation explaining:
        - **What it does** (e.g., "Adds two numbers together").
        - **Examples**: Concrete code examples show how to use the function.
        - **Errors**: Functions that return `Result` types document potential errors, like the `divide` and `sqrt` functions.
        - **Panics**: The `divide` function documentation specifies when a panic might occur if the error is unwrapped improperly.
        - **Safety**: The `power` function includes a safety section, advising caution about potential overflow when raising a number to a large power.
        - **Why**: The rationale for implementing the function in its specific way is explained, such as the use of wrapping arithmetic in `add`.

3. **Detailed Sections**:
    - Sections like `# Examples`, `# Errors`, `# Panics`, and `# Safety` are used where applicable to give a clear understanding of how each function should be used and what to expect in edge cases.

4. **Consistency**:
    - Consistent use of Markdown formatting ensures that the documentation is readable and easy to navigate.
    - Consistent terminology and structure across the documentation help users quickly understand the purpose and behavior of each function.
