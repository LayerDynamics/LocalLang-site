# ENV SETUP
---


To setup the build enviornment run:

```bash
source env_setup.sh
```

if running into issues with libtorch or any of the python run 


```bash 
which python          
which python3
```

it needs to return 

```bash
/opt/miniconda3/envs/locallang/bin/python
/opt/miniconda3/envs/locallang/bin/python3
```

if they arent both from conda major problems will occur.
