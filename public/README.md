## Project Goals

LocalLang aims to:

1. Provide a platform for private, efficient, and local interactions with advanced AI models.
2. Offer an intuitive node-based editor for creating complex AI workflows and pre-prompts.
3. Ensure complete data privacy by running AI models locally on the user's machine.
4. Deliver a customizable and extensible environment through a robust plugin and widget system.
5. Cater to developers, privacy-conscious individuals, and businesses handling sensitive information.
6. Foster a community of developers and users to continually improve the application.

## Key Features

- **Local AI Model Execution**: Run AI models locally for enhanced privacy and reduced latency.
- **Node-Based Workflow Editor**: Visually create and manage AI conversation workflows.
- **Conversation Management**: Store and manage conversation history with various AI models.
- **File Management System**: Robust file handling through modals and widgets.
- **System Resource Monitoring**: Real-time visualization of CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **Settings Management**: Easily configure application settings through a modal interface.
- **Auto-Update Mechanism**: Seamless application updates using Tauri's built-in features.
- **Plugin System**: Extend the application's functionality through a robust plugin API (in development).
- **Widget System**: Customize your workspace with dynamic, user-configurable widgets (in development).
- **Transformer Configuration**: Fine-tune and manage transformer models through an intuitive interface (in development).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Tauri CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/locallang.git
   cd locallang
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launching the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

2. **Using the Node-Based Workflow Editor**:
   - Drag and drop nodes to create conversation structures.
   - Connect nodes to establish the flow of information.
   - Configure individual nodes for specific AI tasks or context setting.

3. **Managing Conversations**:
   - View and continue previous conversations from the conversation list.
   - Export or delete conversations as needed.

4. **File Management**:
   - Open the File Manager from the sidebar.
   - Upload files by dragging and dropping or using the "Upload" button.
   - Select files to include them in your conversations or workflows.

5. **Monitoring System Resources**:
   - Open the System Monitor widget from the dashboard.
   - View real-time updates on CPU, memory, and disk usage.

6. **Customizing the Application**:
   - Adjust settings through the modal interface.
   - (Coming soon) Install and manage plugins for extended functionality.
   - (Coming soon) Add and customize widgets for a personalized experience.

## Architecture

LocalLang is built on a modular architecture using Tauri as the core framework. This allows for a lightweight, efficient desktop application that leverages web technologies for the frontend and Rust for backend operations.

Key components include:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, styled-components
- **Backend**: Rust, SQLite
- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri
- **AI Integration**: Local model execution (specifics may vary based on chosen models)

## Configuration

1. Open the Settings modal from the main menu.
2. Configure your preferences for:
   - AI models and parameters
   - User interface theme
   - File storage locations
   - Plugin settings (once available)
   - Widget layouts (once available)

## Plugin System

The plugin system is currently under development. Once released, it will allow you to:
- Install third-party plugins to extend functionality.
- Develop your own plugins using our comprehensive API.
- Manage and configure installed plugins through the settings interface.

## Widget System

The widget system is in progress. Upon completion, you'll be able to:
- Add, remove, and rearrange widgets on your dashboard.
- Customize widget appearance and behavior.
- Create your own widgets using our widget development framework.
